Next:
    Sober up and summarize whayt I'm doing / where I am.
    Plot best results - make sure grouping makes sense.
    Make sure computing outcomes correctly
    Compare outcomes with channel width.  Anything?


Need to compre with channel width ? ? ? ? 
This is all - I am all on done after this.


did not collect largest spike timing anywhere on channel.
Rha;ts oo bad but wewre going without today.

Am I computing returns correctly.
Maybe not - cause I NEED to assume I can only buy so many at once.
So a ratio of 10:5 might be no different (except for spreads) than 2:1.
Need to investigate this and think it thorough when I asm sober.



Wednesday:
    
    Run program for 4 years( will ake a bunch of hours)
